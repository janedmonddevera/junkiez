          In our current time, there is a drastic need for environmental sustainability as
pollution and waste management problems are evident in our country’s forefront. We
expect the younger generations – often hailed as the most aware of social problems
attributed to their usage and accessibility of information on the internet – to be ones
taking initiative to lead in right practices, however, based on the observations of
the research most Gen Z do not practice proper waste management in
their households despite being very vocal on supporting for environment.

            The Disconnect Between Acknowledging an advocacy and Acting on advocacy
    </p>
    <p class="text-dark pb-2 ">
    Gen Z, born between the late 1990s and early 2010s, has grown
up now. They live in a world increasingly aware of environmental issues.
They are are the generation of Greta Thunberg known activist, climate strikes and protests,
products that harm groups of individuals. Yet, when it comes to day-to-day
actions like waste segregation, recycling, and reducing household waste, there
seems to be a cognitive gap between their advocacy and actual behavior.

    Moving Forward: How Gen Z Can Lead the Change
</p>
<p class="text-dark pb-2 ">
As the next generation to be the dominant workforce going forward, Gen Z needs
to live up to their reputation as environmental stewards.  A shift in mindset
and behavior is necessary. The following below
Educate Themselves and Others: Seek out information on effective
waste management practices and share this knowledge within their communities.
Make Small, Consistent Changes: Start with simple actions like reducing plastic
use, recycling correctly, and composting food scraps.
Hold Themselves Accountable: Recognize that every individual action counts and
make a conscious effort to reduce waste in daily life.
Leverage Technology for Good: Use apps and online resources to track waste
management efforts and stay informed about best practices.
